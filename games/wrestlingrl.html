    <h1>WrestlingRL</h1>
    <img src="wrestlingrl.png">
    <p>Made for 7DRL 2022, utilizing PDCurses. Really weird and complex control system for wrestling your opponent. I had a lot of fun making this and am still a bit proud of it.
        Released March 13th, 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initial game screen will be blank press any key to fix that
        <br>
        Goal is to win 10 matches in a row to win championship match of tournament
        <br>
        3 different position metrics
        <br>
        -Mat Position: On Mat, In Air
        <br>
        -Space Position: Forward, Back
        <br>
        -Facing: Down, Up
        <br>
        Win by putting your enemy's back in the position, On Mat Down (Space Position doesn't matter here)
        <br>
        Use the different actions to do this
        <br>
        Grab a limb and commit any of 8 actions
        <br>
        As well 3 non-grab related actions
        <br>
        12 limbs
        <br>
        Some limbs when moved will move others
        <br>
        Some limbs can't be moved without other limbs in certain positions
        <br>
        Can resist enemy movements with resist action
        <br>
        Can hold limbs in a position with hold action
        <br>
        Other actions are pretty self explanatory
        <br>
        Grabbing multiple limbs will increase your chance of success as the enemy will have too much to focus on
        <br>
        As well between matches you get to increase the power of your limbs
