    <h1>Crack Addict RPG</h1>
    <img src="crackaddict.png">
    <p>Made over summer in olcCodeJam 2021. Wrote the whole game in like 5 hours because I threw away everything I had been working on cause I though it was bad.
        Ended up making a weirdly satisfying game to play for a few minutes. Released September 5th, 2021.
