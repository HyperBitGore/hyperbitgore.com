    <h1>In the Belly of the Beast</h1>
    <img src="belly.gif">
    <p>Made this for Bullet Hell Jam 2022, using SDL2. Gameplay is based around shooting through enemys to hit weakspots. Probably my best game jam game, still not amazing.
        I am a bit proud for the systems made within the timeframe since everything was written from scratch mostly. 
    </p>
    <p>
    You are a fish swallowed by one of the great fish behemoths swimming your lake. Now you must fight your way to his vital organs and kill him to escape. 
    <br>
    Avoid bullets as the level changes around you. Collect the guts from the other fish for more score

    Arrow keys to move
    Z to shoot
